Hello.

Let me guess. You might have played many different strategy games in your childhood, right?  
Why do all of us enjoy such games? They immerse us to various worlds, making us warriors, colonels, or kings.
They gave us ability to develop our own state, to fight against others etc. 

I was just the same child. I was inspired by "The Heroes of Might and Magic" and "Civilization" games. 
But now I can not only develop my country, but also create the entire world where new countries can be developed.
And I want to share this magic with you!
